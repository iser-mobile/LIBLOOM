# LIBLOOM
LIBLOOM is designed for third-party library (TPL) detection in Android apps, which encodes the signature of each class into an individual Bloom filter for fast containment queries and then performs TPL detection on the query results. Advanced non-structure-preserving (NSP) obfuscations including class repackaging and package flattening are heuristically addressed in it.
